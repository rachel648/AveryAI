Project: Smart Glasses for the Visually Impaired

This project aims to empower individuals with visual impairments through the use of smart glasses. The smart glasses are designed to assist blind and visually impaired users by providing real-time audio feedback, enabling them to navigate their surroundings with greater independence and confidence. Using advanced sensors and AI, the glasses detect obstacles, read text aloud, and provide directions, creating a more inclusive and accessible world for those with visual disabilities.
